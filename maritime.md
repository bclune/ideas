Manage deadlines by setting recurring notifications for development milestones
and deployments.

Initial list of features:
- Notifications (email, push?, etc.) for upcoming deadlines
- Calendar showing progress: week by week or day by day (don't break the 
  chain!)
- Count down to ship date, count up from last ship date, count sustained 
- Choose an update frequency. Ship code every day, every week, every X hours!
- API to confirm that code is shipped (for VCS integration)
- RESTful API for displaying information, time left

Later features:
- Share milestones between users (team support)
- Notification snooze
- Integration with GitHub issues tracking - add directly to milestones,
  complete automatically when closed
